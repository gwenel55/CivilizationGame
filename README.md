<h1>HotCiv Implementation</h1>
<h4>By: Gwen Litwak, Ryan Hankee, Chloe Lam</h4>

This Repository Contains every variant of our implementation of the HotCiv game. By creating variants of the game as we went, we were able to use the git branching commands to easily manipulate and expand our program without concerns about comprising any of the current functionality. White Box and Black Box testing were used to evaluate the accuracy of every variant in our implementation.

<h3>Differences in Versions</h3>
Each version of the game comes with its own set of rules and ways to win the game. The requirements and conditions become more complex with each new version, starting with the ability to allow the user to change turns, and finishing with requiring the player to own all the cities placed by the opponents' troops on the board in order to win.

<h3>How to Play</h3>
By Running ShowSemiCiv, you can run the final implementation of the project, where troops can move on the board, and use their abilities to affect the game by clicking on the entity+shift.
